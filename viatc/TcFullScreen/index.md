TcFullScreen.exe 
=================
The following TcFullScreen.exe file is not mine and I cannot find it anywhere to give credit to.
<A href="TcFullScreen.zip" >TcFullScreen.zip</a> size: 22Kb<br>  
This exe works as an addition to "Total Commander" = TC. You can map it in TC as a shortcut, or if you put TcFullScreen.exe in ViATc folder, then it's already mapped in viatc.ini file to F11 and like this:   <br>  
,s=&lt;TCFullScreenWithExePlugin&gt;

You don't need that file. ViATc has buil-in FullSreen (100% FullSreen, even the Windows taskbar is hidden)
zf=&lt;TCFullScreen&gt;
~=&lt;TCFullScreen&gt;
