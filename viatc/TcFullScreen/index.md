ViATc - Vim mode at Total Commander  


The following file is not mine and I cannot find it anywhere to give credit to.
<A href="TcFullScreen.exe" >TcFullScreen.exe</a> size: 40Kb<br>  
This exe works as an addition to "Total Commander", you can map it in TC as a shortcut, or if you put TcFullScreen.exe in ViATc folder you can map it like this:   <br>  
,s=&lt;TCFullScreenWithExePlugin&gt;
