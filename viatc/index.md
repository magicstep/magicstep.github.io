This software works on Windows and only as an addition to "Total Commander" - the greatest file manager (keyboard friendly, two panels, advanced search, comparator, multi-rename, FTP, plugins) get it from <a href="www.ghisler.com">ghisler.com</a>
ViATc tries to resemble the work-flow of Vim and web browser plugins like Vimium or better yet SurfingKeys.

What ViATc does to Total Commander (called later TC):
- it's only a separate addition, easily disabled, it doesn't modify TC
- adds more functionality - supports all that AutoHotkey does, not just TC
- adds more shortcuts, you can add and reconfigure them

Download
========
2020/11/01  version 0.5.5en beta 20  
<a href="ViATc-0.5.5en_beta20_executable.zip">ViATc-0.5.5en_beta20_executable.zip</a><br>
The zip file contains a script and exe file. I promise that the exe file is clean, however compiled AHK scripts trigger antiviruses so you might have to add an exception. The script choice is recommended anyway.   

To get the most recent script (without exe), download <a href="https://github.com/magicstep/ViATc-English/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/magicstep/ViATc-English/archive/master.zip</a> 

Old versions at <a href="https://magicstep.github.io/viatc/old.html">https://magicstep.github.io/viatc/old.html</a> 

Installation
============
- After downloading ViATc, extract, put it in any location and use it.  
- You can run the script if you have Autohotkey installed. Download and install Autohotkey, it is powerful for many purposes. https://autohotkey.com  
- Run ViATc and look for a new icon in the tray, right-click on it and choose Help or Settings to get accustomed to the shortcuts.

Settings
========
You can add and remove shortcuts via the ViATc Settings window. After changes you must click Save or OK (OK will save and reload ViaTC).  
You can also add and remove shortcuts directly in the ini file. Reload ViATc manually after any changes made directly in the ini file to take effect.
In the ini file all lines that begin with a semicolon ; are ignored. It's a standard comment in ini files.  

CapsLock is mapped as Escape. To bypass this try ctrl+CapsLock
